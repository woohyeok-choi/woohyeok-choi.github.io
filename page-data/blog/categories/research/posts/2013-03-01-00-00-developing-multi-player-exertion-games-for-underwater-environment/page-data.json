There has been a massive amount of exergames succeeded in the marget, ranging from Konami's Dance Dance Revolution to (very recently) Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure. However, almost all exergames focused on gamifying ground-based exercise, and aquatic exercise has been gained a little attention in an exergame world. Actually, an aquatic environment is very challenging to design exergames, mainly because users' sensory capabilities would be limited underwater so that a very special game mechanic should be required.</p>","excerpt":"Even though exertion-based games (or, exergame) are regarded as promising ways to promote physical activities, most of them has consideredâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"Developing multi-player exertion games for underwater environment","date":"2013-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","lang":"en"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/categories/research/posts/2013-03-01-00-00-developing-multi-player-exertion-games-for-underwater-environment","category":{"name":"Research","slug":"/blog/categories/research"},"tags":[{"name":"Exergame","slug":"/blog/tags/exergame"},{"name":"Swimming","slug":"/blog/tags/swimming"},{"name":"Underwater network","slug":"/blog/tags/underwater-network"},{"name":"Activity recognition","slug":"/blog/tags/activity-recognition"}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/categories/research/posts/2013-03-01-00-00-developing-multi-player-exertion-games-for-underwater-environment","prevPost":{"title":"Developing multi-player exertion games for group fitness swimming","slug":"/blog/categories/research/posts/2014-04-01-00-00-developing-multi-player-exertion-games-for-group-fitness-swimming"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1450361863","2396922309","2890333836","3128451518","3836358870"]}
